# 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Using Python

This project is part of the **Cloudcredits Data Analytics Internship** and aims to perform exploratory data analysis on a Zomato dataset. The analysis reveals patterns in restaurant ratings, costs, types, and online ordering behavior.

## 📊 Objective

- Understand the distribution of ratings, votes, and restaurant types.
- Analyze the impact of online orders on customer ratings.
- Clean and transform messy data (e.g., rates, cost).
- Visualize key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Converted `rate` values from text (e.g., "4.2/5", "NEW") to floats.
- Cleaned `approx_cost(for two people)` to remove commas and ensure numerical data.
- Removed missing or invalid data entries.

## 📈 Key Visualizations

- Count plot of restaurant types
- Bar chart of total votes per type
- Online order availability distribution
- Histogram of customer ratings
- Box plot of rating vs online order
- Heatmap of restaurant type vs online ordering

## 🧠 Insights

- Some restaurant types attract significantly more votes.
- Online ordering influences ratings, as shown in the box plot.
- Ratings and cost distributions are skewed.
- The heatmap reveals trends between restaurant types and online ordering options.

## 📁 Files Included

- `Zomato Data Analysis.ipynb` – Complete Jupyter notebook with code and visuals.
- `zomatoo.pptx` – Power point  report of the analysis.
